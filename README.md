# Magento 2 - Improved Import / Export extension  

We’ve started a new project aimed at improving the default Magento 2 import / export functionality. Although this process is significantly refined now, it still lacks some important features; therefore we are developing this Magento 2 extension. Now, you can easily import product custom options, product images from remote URL, or tier prices out-of-the-box, but there is still room for improvement. 

The Improved Import / Export Magento 2 extension provides the ability to import a CSV file with product data and product images from a remote FTP server or a cloud storage such as Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive. There is also an opportunity to perform the export of products and images to the same location. Due to a scheduled cron job feature, the extension offers automated product updates from a cloud storage. Thus, you can easily connect your Magento 2 store with 3th party tools, warehouses, product inventory management (PIM) systems, etc. As you can see, Improved Import / Export for Magento 2 is useful for automated product stock status updates as well as any other product attribute updates.
